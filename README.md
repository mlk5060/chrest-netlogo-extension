To use the CHREST extension in your Netlogo model follow the steps listed below:

  1. Declare a breed variable called "chrest-instance" for the breed of turtles that are to be endowed with a 
     CHREST instance in the Netlogo model.
    
  2. Have all turtles of the breed that are to be endowed with an instance of the CHREST architecture
     call the "instantiate-chrest-in-turtle".
