Configuring Extension to Work with Unsupported Models
-----------------------------------------------------

If the model you are looking to use the CHREST extension in is not currently supported you
need to add code to the "NetlogoChrestInputOutputInterface.java" file.

Creating Turtles endowed with CHREST in a Netlogo Model
-------------------------------------------------------

To create turtles endowed with their own instancse of the CHREST Java class in a Netlogo model 
follow the steps listed below:

1) Ensure that the model using the extension actually supports the extension.
2) The filename of your model should match the filenames given in the "Netlogo Models that 
   Support the CHREST Extension" section above.  If not, the extension will be unable to 
   provide an interface between your Netlogo model and the CHREST architecture.
3) In your Netlogo model, ensure that the breed of turtles that are to be endowed with a 
   CHREST instance:
   a) Have a breed variable called "chrest-instance".
   b) Calls the "chrest:instantiate-chrest-in-agent" primitive when agents are being setup.
